# What Time Is It?

Scala CLI and Cats Effect Port of the "What Time Is it?" CLI app from Lesson 13 of Daniela Sfregola's *Get Programming with Scala* book: https://github.com/DanielaSfregola/get-programming-with-scala/tree/main/unit2/lesson13

Since I am familiar with Haskell and have tried out Cats Effect, I challenged myself to translate the app from this lesson using Cats Effect.
